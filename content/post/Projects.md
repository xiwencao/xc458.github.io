#### Does market manipulation affect stock price crashes? 
Nanjing University, Nanjing, CN

2022.2-2022.6  

> Processed 3-secondes high frequency data, constructed an identification model for tail market manipulation.
>
> Employed a generalized logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of stock crashes; alleviated the problem of unbalanced data set and the out-of-sample accuracy was 70%.

#### Citicup Financial Innovation Competition(team of 20)
Citi, Shanghai, CN  

2021.9-2021.12 

>Built Portfolio Recommendation System based on Analyst Network and customized to client preferences.
>
>Constructed and back-tested portfolios in Analyst Network to meet client needs and tune model hyper-parameters; won first prize in this competition of 156 teams.

#### Neural Networks for Forecasting Market Returns(team of 3)
Nanjing University, Nanjing, CN  

2021.2-2021.7

>Bulit multi-layer feed-forward neural network, ensemble neural network, general regression neural network, and probabilistic neural network to predict excess returns of S&P 500 investment portfolio.
>
>Applied information gain to select input features, and conducted back-testing and simulated trading to compare different models; the result suggested that trading strategies guided by the neural network classification models generate higher profits under the same risk.
